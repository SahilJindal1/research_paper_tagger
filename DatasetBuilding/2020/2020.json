overwhelms the training. the most commonly used cross entropy (ce) criteria is actually an accuracy-oriented objective, and thus creates a discrepancy between training and test: at training time, each training instance contributes equally to the objective function, while at test time f1 score concerns more about positive examples. in this paper, we propose to use dice loss in replacement of the standard cross-entropy objective for data-imbalanced nlp tasks. dice loss is based on the s\u00f8rensen--dice coefficient or tversky index , which attaches similar importance to false positives and false negatives, and is more immune to the data-imbalance issue. to further alleviate the dominating influence from easy-negative examples in training, we propose to associate training examples with dynamically adjusted weights to deemphasize easy-negative examples. theoretical analysis shows that this strategy narrows down the gap between the f1 score in evaluation and the dice loss in training.

both faithful to models and interpretable to humans."], ["how does bert\u2019s attention change when you fine-tune? an analysis methodology and a case study in negation scope", "yiyun zhao | steven bethard", "large pretrained language models like bert, after fine-tuning to a downstream task, have achieved high performance on a variety of nlp problems. yet explaining their decisions is difficult despite recent work probing their internal representations. we propose a procedure and analysis methods that take a hypothesis of how a transformer-based model might encode a linguistic phenomenon, and test the validity of that hypothesis based on a comparison between knowledge-related downstream tasks with downstream control tasks, and measurement of cross-dataset consistency. we apply this methodology to test bert and roberta on a hypothesis that some attention heads will consistently attend from a word in negation scope to the negation cue. we find that after fine-tuning bert and roberta on a negation scope task, the average attention head improves its sensitivity to negation and its attention consistency across negation datasets compared to the pre-trained models. however, only the base models (not the large models) improve compared to a control task, indicating there is evidence for a shallow encoding of negation only in the base models."]]}
