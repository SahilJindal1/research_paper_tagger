o(n). in practice, however, lstms are much slower to train than self-attention networks as they cannot be parallelized at sequence level: to model context, the current lstm state relies on the full

classification is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing. previous studies have difficulties to distinguish similar labels well because they learn the same document representations for different labels, that is they do not explicitly extract label-specific semantic components from documents. moreover, they do not fully explore the high-order interactions among these semantic components, which is very helpful to predict tail labels. in this paper, we propose a novel label-specific dual graph neural network (ldgn), which incorporates category information to learn label-specific components from documents, and employs dual graph convolution network (gcn) to model complete and adaptive interactions among these components based on the statistical label co-occurrence and dynamic reconstruction graph in a joint way. experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that ldgn significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models, and also achieves better performance with respect to tail labels."], ["concept-based label embedding via dynamic routing for hierarchical text classification", "xuepeng wang | li zhao | bing liu | tao chen | feng zhang | di wang", "hierarchical text classification (htc) is a challenging task that categorizes a textual description within a taxonomic hierarchy. most of the existing methods focus on modeling the text. recently, researchers attempt to model the class representations with some resources (e.g., external dictionaries). however, the concept shared among classes which is a kind of domain-specific and fine-grained information has been ignored in previous work. in this paper, we propose a novel concept-based label embedding method that can explicitly represent the concept and model the sharing mechanism among classes for the hierarchical text classification. experimental results on two widely used datasets prove that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. we release our complementary resources (concepts and definitions of classes) for these two datasets to benefit the research on htc."], ["tan-ntm: topic attention networks for neural topic modeling", "madhur panwar | shashank shailabh | milan aggarwal | balaji krishnamurthy", "topic models have been widely used to learn text representations and gain insight into document corpora. to perform topic discovery, most existing neural models either take document bag-of-words (bow) or sequence of tokens as input followed by variational inference and bow reconstruction to learn topic-word distribution. however, leveraging topic-word distribution for learning better features during document encoding has not been explored much. to this end, we develop a framework tan-ntm, which processes document as a sequence of tokens through a lstm whose contextual outputs are attended in a topic-aware manner. we propose a novel attention mechanism which factors in topic-word distribution to enable the model to attend on relevant words that convey topic related cues. the output of topic attention module is then used to carry out variational inference. we perform extensive ablations and experiments resulting in ~9-15 percentage improvement over score of existing sota topic models in npmi coherence on several benchmark datasets - 20newsgroups, yelp review polarity and agnews. further, we show that our method learns better latent document-topic features compared to existing topic models through improvement on two downstream tasks: document classification and topic guided keyphrase
